                    <h2>Improving Slpeep Quality</h2>
                    <p>Enhancing sleep quality is essential for overall health and well-being. Prioritize a consistent sleep schedule and create a relaxing bedtime routine to promote restful sleep.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Consistent Sleep Schedule:</strong> Maintain a regular sleep-wake cycle by going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, even on weekends, to regulate your body's internal clock.</li>
                        <li><strong>Create a Relaxing Bedtime Routine:</strong> Establish calming pre-sleep rituals such as reading, taking a warm bath, or practicing relaxation techniques to signal to your body that it's time to wind down.</li>
                        <li><strong>Optimize Sleep Environment:</strong> Make your bedroom conducive to sleep by keeping it dark, quiet, and cool. Invest in a comfortable mattress and pillows, and consider using white noise machines or earplugs to block out disturbances.</li>
                        <li><strong>Limit Screen Time Before Bed: </strong>Minimize exposure to electronic devices such as smartphones, tablets, and computers at least an hour before bedtime, as the blue light emitted can disrupt your body's production of melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep.</li>
